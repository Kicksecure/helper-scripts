## Not using 'apt-get' option '--yes'. Reasons:
## Some may want 'apt-get-noninteractive' to include '--yes' as the name suggests.
## Using APT non-interactively is a bit of rocket science.
## A plethora of options and environment variables must be set; nobody wants to do
## that manually.
## One way to use 'apt-get-noninteractive' is to run it and check if its output
## indicates APT might destroy the system (e.g., due to broken packages removing
## a critical package).
## If all is OK, confirm with Enter. Easy.
## If already sure, simply run 'apt-get-noninteractive --yes'.
## If '--yes' were the default, one would need to check the outcome with 'apt-get',
## first then Ctrl+C, then use 'apt-get-noninteractive' to actually proceed.
## It is unknown if 'apt-get-noninteractive' might behave differently due to the
## numerous options passed compared to 'apt-get'.
## This is an opinionated choice.
